# AI/ML Integration in Cucumber Playwright TypeScript Framework

## Overview
This framework integrates AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) capabilities to automate and enhance test generation, validation, and performance analysis.

## **Key AI/ML Features**
### ✅ AI-Driven Test Generation
- Uses an internal **LLM (Large Language Model)** to generate Gherkin feature files based on:
  - Functional requirements
  - Historical test data
  - Source code analysis

### ✅ Automated Feature and Step Definition Creation
- AI auto-generates structured **Feature files** and **Step definitions** based on predefined best practices.
- Ensures step definitions use **Playwright’s latest methods** and follow Cucumber TypeScript compatibility.

### ✅ Intelligent Test Optimization
- Implements **feedback loops** to analyze test failures and improve AI-generated tests dynamically.
- Reduces redundant test scenarios and optimizes test coverage.

## **Automated AI/ML Validation Features**
### 📌 Image Classification Testing
#### `@ValidateConsistentImageLabeling`
**Feature: Validate Correct Image Labeling**
- Ensures AI models correctly classify images as “cat” or “dog.”
- Validates model accuracy with a minimum **50% threshold.**

```gherkin
Scenario: Validate correct labeling for a set of cat and dog images
  Given a pre-trained image classification model for identifying cats and dogs is loaded
  When I input a set of images containing cats and dogs
  Then each image should be correctly labeled as "cat" or "dog" with at least 50% accuracy
```

---

### 📌 Model Training & Verification
#### `@VerifyTrainedModel`
**Feature: Verify Trained Model**
- Ensures the model's prediction accuracy for known inputs.
- Used for validating AI model performance after training.

```gherkin
Scenario: Train and test a simple TensorFlow model
  Given I have trained a simple TensorFlow model
  When I input the value 5
  Then the prediction should be close to 9
```

---

## **Performance & Load Testing for AI Models**
### ⚡ Scalability & Latency Testing
- Ensures AI models **maintain performance** under increasing load.
- Uses **k6 & Grafana** for real-time monitoring.

```gherkin
Scenario: Measure response time under normal load
  Given an AI model serving 100 requests per second
  When predictions are requested
  Then the response time should be under 50ms
```
---

## **Security & Compliance**
- **Ensures federal security compliance** (e.g., Trusted Internet Connection (TIC)).
- **Automates bias detection** in AI models using fairness analysis.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Property-based Testing** for AI-generated test coverage.
- **Fuzz Testing** to detect edge case failures in ML models.
- **Self-learning test cases** based on real-world execution data.

🚀 **With AI/ML-driven automation, we achieve higher efficiency, reliability, and compliance across all AI testing workflows.**
