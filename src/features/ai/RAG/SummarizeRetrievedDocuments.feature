Feature: Summarize Retrievald Documents
    As a customer service agent
    I want to summarize retrieved documents
    So that I can provide accurate information to customers

    Background:
        Given the AI system is ready for document summarization
        And the retrieval system has relevant documents

    Scenario: Generate concise summary from multiple documents
        Given retrieved documents include user manuals and troubleshooting guides
        When the model generates a summary
        Then the summary should be less than 200 words

    Scenario: Include key points in the summary
        Given retrieved documents include product specifications and warranty information
        When the model generates a summary
        Then the summary should highlight key features and warranty terms

    Scenario: Generate accurate case summary for agent handoff
        Given retrieved documents include case history, prior interactions, and resolution steps
        When the model generates a summary
        Then the summary should include the root cause and recommended fix

    Scenario: Ensure summary only includes facts from retrieved content
        Given the retrieved documents contain 3 knowledge articles on integration APIs
        When the AI summarizes the documents
        Then the summary should not include features not mentioned in the documents
