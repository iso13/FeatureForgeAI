Feature: Validate Agentic AI Workflow for Capital Call Notifications
    As a fund administrator,
    I want the AI agent to autonomously generate and deliver capital call notifications,
    So that investor communications are accurate, timely, and traceable.

    Background:
        Given the AI agent has access to investor records and fund agreements

    Scenario: Execute agent workflow for capital call notification
        When the AI agent is instructed to notify investors of a capital call
        Then the agent should generate a capital call summary
        And the agent should validate compliance of the generated summary
        And the agent should send the notification to each investor
        And each step should be logged with a timestamp

    Scenario: Handle missing investor data during agent execution
        And the investor records are incomplete
        When the AI agent attempts to generate a capital call summary
        Then the agent should log an error indicating missing data
        And the agent should halt the workflow and notify the administrator

    Scenario: Retry notification delivery after failure
        And the notification service is temporarily unavailable
        When the AI agent attempts to send notifications
        Then the agent should retry delivery with exponential backoff
        And the agent should log each retry attempt

    Scenario: Update investor data and resume agent execution
        And the agent previously failed due to missing data
        When the administrator provides the missing investor records
        And the agent resumes the workflow
        Then the agent should complete all remaining steps successfully
